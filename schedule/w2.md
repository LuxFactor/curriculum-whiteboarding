# Week 2

As of March 27, 2017, the Fibonacci question comes from whiteboarding
prompt #2A, and the sum_rec question comes from #1B.

## Student A

Questions you will be asked:

1. Fibs

Write a method, fibs(num) which returns the first n elements from the
Fibonacci sequence, given n.

Solve it both iteratively and recursively.

2. Agile Question

Define "Test-Driven Development" and "Continuous Integration". Also,
what are their benefits?

Questions you will be asking:

1. Recursive Sum

Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns their sum.
Use recursion.

Answer:

def sum_rec(nums)
  return 0 if nums.empty?
  nums[0] + sum_rec(nums.drop(1))
end

Questions you will be asking:

1. Fibs

Write a method, fibs(num) which returns the first n elements from the
Fibonacci sequence, given n.

Solve it both iteratively and recursively.

Answer:

Iterative Solution:

def fibs(num)
  return [] if num == 0
  return [0] if num == 1

  fibs = [0, 1]
  while fibs.count < num
    fibs << fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]
  end

  fibs
end

Recursive Solution:

def fibs(num)
  return [] if num == 0
  return [0] if num == 1
  return [0, 1] if num == 2

  prev_fibs = fibs(num - 1)
  prev_fibs << prev_fibs[-1]  + prev_fibs[-2]

  prev_fibs
end

2. Agile Question

Define "Test-Driven Development" and "Continuous Integration". Also,
what are their benefits?

Answer:



A benefit of Test-Driven Development is that it allows for safer
refactoring.
