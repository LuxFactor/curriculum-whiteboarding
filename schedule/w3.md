# Week 3

As of April 6, 2017, the SQL question comes from whiteboarding
prompt #3A.

## Student A

Questions you will be asking:

1. OOP – Jukebox

Design a musical jukebox using object-oriented principles.

Solution:

Here are some answers to questions the interviewee might ask:

#### Is the jukebox physical or virtual?

Assume the jukebox is virtual or computer-simulated.

#### Does the jukebox accept currency?

Assume the jukebox operates free of charge.

Here is the skeleton of a potential solution:

```ruby
class Jukebox
  attr_accessor :user
  attr_reader :current_track

  def initialize(player, user)
    @player = player
    @user = user
    @current_track = nil
  end
end

class Player
  attr_accessor :album, :playlist

  def initialize(album, playlist)
    @album = album
    @playlist = playlist
  end

  def play_track(track)
    # Begin playing...
  end
end

class Playlist
  def initialize
    @queue = []
  end

  def add_track(track)
    @queue.push(track)
  end

  def shift
    @queue.shift
  end
end

class Album
  # Information about the album
end

class Track
  # Information about the track, including album
end

class User
  # Information about the user.
end
```

2. SQL – Employees

In a SQL db, you have two tables, an employees table and a departments
table. Employees belong to only one department. Write a SQL query that,
given a department name, finds all the employees in that department.

Solution:

```sql
SELECT
  employees.*
FROM
  employees e
JOIN
  departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE
  d.name = ?
```

## Student B

Questions you will be asking:

1. Caesar Cipher

Write a function that takes a message and an increment amount and
outputs the same letters shifted by that amount in the alphabet. Assume
lowercase and no punctuation. Preserve spaces.

Solution:

The most time-efficient way to approach this problem is to create a
dictionary of letters using a structure that makes it easy and fast to
access a letter at any position in the alphabet. An array will do this
for us -- arrays allow us to access a value at any index in constant
time.

```ruby
def caesar_cipher(str, shift)
  letters = ("a".."z").to_a

  encoded_str = ""
  str.each_char do |char|
    if char == " "
      encoded_str << " "
      next
    end

    old_idx = letters.find_index(char)
    new_idx = (old_idx + shift) % letters.count

    encoded_str << letters[new_idx]
  end

  encoded_str
end
```

2. OOP – Parking Lot

Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.

(Don't spend too much time fleshing out actual methods. Aim to give a
holistic view of which methods exist on each of the classes.)

Solution:

This question is very open-ended. The interviewee should ask questions
to specify what the design expectations are.

Ensure that the interviewee aims to satisfy the following:

* Each parking lot can have many floors.
* Each parking lot allows for various kinds of vehicles to park. Assume
these are motorcycle, car, and bus. Each of these has a different size.
* There are multiple parking spot sizes. Assume those sizes are compact
and regular.
* The rules for parking a vehicle in a spot are something like this:
  * Motorcycles can take any parking spot, whether regular or compact.
    (They require, say, four feet of parking space.)
  * Cars can take any regular spot. (They require, say, an eight foot
    wide spot.)
  * Buses require, say, forty feet of parking space, so they will have
    to take multiple spaces.

Obviously, there are many other possible questions about the structure,
but the interviewee can assume that anything beyond these specifics are
left to their discretion.

What follows below would be a skeleton for a valid approach:

```ruby
class Vehicle
  attr_reader :spots_needed, :size

  def initialize(license_plate)
    @parking_spots = []
    @license_plate = license_plate
  end

  def park_in_spot(spot)
    # ...
  end

  def clear_spots
    # ...
  end

  def can_fit_in_spot(spot)
    # ...
  end
end

class Bus < Vehicle
  def initialize
    super
    @spots_needed = 5
    @size = :large
  end

  def can_fit_in_spot(spot)
    # Checks if spot is :large
  end
end

class Car < Vehicle
  def initialize
    super
    @spots_needed = 1
    @size = :compact
  end

  def can_fit_in_spot(spot)
    # Check if spot is :compact or :large
  end
end

class Motorcycle < Vehicle
  def initialize
    super
    @spots_needed = 1
    @size = :compact
  end
end

class ParkingLot
  def initialize
    @levels = # generate_levels
  end

  def park_vehicle(vehicle)
    # Park the vehicle in a spot or multiple spots. Return false if failed.
  end
end

class Level
  def initialize(floor, num_spots)
    @spots = # generate spots
    @available_spots = num_spots
    @floor = floor
  end

  def park_vehicle(vehicle)
    # Find a place to park vehicle or return false.
  end

  def park_starting_at(spot_num, vehicle)
    # Park a vehicle starting at spot number and continue until vehicle.spots_needed.
  end

  def find_available_spots(vehicle)
    # Find a spot to park the vehicle. Return index of spot or -1.
  end

  def spot_freed
    @available_spots += 1
  end
end

class ParkingSpot
  attr_reader :row, :spot_num

  def initialize(size, level, row, spot_num)
    @vehicle = nil
    @spot_size = size
    @level = level
    @row = row
    @spot_num = spot_num
  end

  def is_free?
    !@vehicle
  end

  def can_fit_vehicle?(vehicle)
    # Check it will fit.
  end

  def park(vehicle)
    # Park in spot
  end

  def unpark
    # Remove vehicle from spot and notify level that a new spot is available.
  end
end
```
